/**
 * This is used to dynamically add an extension's routes - since we can't do this
 * if the extension's module is lazy-loaded.
 *
 * This CanActive plugin typically is added to the route config to catch all unknown routes '**'
 * When activated, it removes itself from the routing config, so it only ever activates once.
 *
 * It checks if there are any new routes from extensions that need to be added and add them.
 *
 * Lastly, it navigates to the same route that it intercepted - if a new extension route
 * was added that now matches, it gets the route, otherwise the route goes up the chain
 * as it would have before.

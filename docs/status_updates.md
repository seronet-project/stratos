# Status Updates

Weekly status updates are published here.

## 12 April 2019
This week the Stratos team has been...
- Presenting Stratos v2.4 features to the community in the latest project update
- Working towards phase two of the extension project.
- Finishing off the remove roles from cf user feature.
- Finishing off adding an optional 'connect' step to the register endpoint stepper.
- Reviewing and shepherding PRs into master, minor bug fixes.

## 5 April 2019
This week the Stratos team have mostly been ...
- Improving e2e reliability and merging existing PRs.
- Improving the create/deploy app flow. Users will now only be presented with a single button to start the flow. Their first step is to decide where the source for the app will come from (github, gitlab, locally, etc) or to create without source.
- Removing the endpoints page when there's no persistent storage. This is now on par with the home/favourites page.
- Adding an option that will allow the user to stay signed in to the console (if option is checked and the page remains visible).
- Starting working towards the ability to remove all roles from a cf user with a single click (after confirmation).
- Starting working towards an optional 'connect' step when registering an endpoint.
- Fixed a few minor trivial bugs

## 22 March 2019

This week:

- Work continues to complete the addition of support for Cloud Foundry User Provided Services. This is almost done. A few small issues and corner-cases cropped up which we have been working on.

## 8 March 2019

This week:

- Added a card view to the endpoints view
- Continued to refine the support for User Provided Service Instances
- Working on support to allow list views to show different entity types in the same list
- Ensured features requiring persistence database are not enabled when using SQLite

## 1 March 2019

This week:

https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2019-3783/
https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2019-3784/

**Deployment Survey**

We want to understand more about how everyone is deploying Stratos - so we can better support the most used deployment scenarios and (possibly) remove some of the deployment mechanisms that aren’t being used - we’ve got a quick survey we’d love it if you could fill out: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/MLXDMKG

## 15 February 2019

This week:

- 2.3.0 was Released!
- The user Favourites feature has been reviewed and merged
- We continue to fix and merge many of the outstanding PRs around User Favourites and Scalability
- We spent half a day reviewing our next steps to re-structure the front-end code as part of our work towards the next phase of extensibility.
- We continue to improve the suite of automated deployment tests that run continuosuly

## 8 February 2019

Release 2.3.0 is all ready to go and we will publish this on Monday.

Otherwise, we've been working on:

- Finishing a first version of the User Favourites feature
- Finishing a first version of the User Invitation feature
- Investigating possible security issue: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues/3385
- Updates to our extensions approach 

## 1 February 2019

We are looking to release 2.3.0 next week having completed testing.

Work has otherwise continued on four tracks:

- Discussing integration of the Autoscaler (https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-autoscaler) UI (https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-autoscaler-ui) into Stratos. We’ve provided a first round of guidance to the Autoscaler team and are looking forward to the second round next week. The initial designs look great.
- Knowledge sharing activities revolving helm charts and concourse release pipelines

## 26th October 2018

The team were away attending a workshop this week.

The only item of note is that we have now forked the go-flags package that was causing broken dependency issues for us and updated Stratos to use this package. This should allow us to avoid future issues with this package.

## 19th October 2018

We are preparing for this month's 2.2.0 release which will be out towards the end of the month.

Highlights for this week:

- Extensions: Fix for side nav. Add initial docs [\#3140](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/3140)

- Stratos frontend can be pre-built before pushing to Cloud Foundry to enable AOT and reduce push time
- SSO support refinements with the ability to now connect a Cloud Foundry endpoint using SSO in addition to SSO login to Straos itself
- Ability to specify manifest overrides when deploying an application
- Ability to optionally specify Client ID anc Client Secret when registering an endpoint
- Add ability to restage an application
- Endpoints list now shows logged in user's username and whether they're an admin
- Switched to new Stratos logo for login and about pages
- Backend improvements to make it easier for developers to develop with
- Security fixes

Full release information is available [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/releases/tag/2.1.0).

Highlights for this week (continuing from last week):

- Extensions - Work continues on adding extension points in the UI. Extensions is targeted for 2.2.0 in October.

- Fix bug where token IDs are not set properly when upgrading from a previous version [#3017](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/3017)

## 14th September 2018

We've been preparing the 2.1.0 release this week. This will be published next week. Going forward we will be publishing a new release every month. The release notes for 2.1.0 have been created and are [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/blob/v2-master/CHANGELOG.md#210).

Highlights for this week:

- Extensions - Work continues on adding extension points in the UI. We have PRs up to support adding new side-nav items, tabs and actions. This already goes beyond what could be done in V1 of Stratos. The extension mechanism is also much cleaner due to the use of decorators. Extensions is targeted for 2.2.0 in October.

- E2E Tests and Automation - Continuing to build out the E2E test suite and automate the deploy and test of Stratos in different environments (pushed to Cloud Foundry, pushed to Cloud Foundry with MySQL and Postgres, pushed to Cloud Foundry with SSO, Docker compose, Docker All-in-One)

- Metrics - Work is almost complete on improving the metrics integration and presentation in the UI. Rather than display a timeline under each graph, we are switching to a control to allow you to choose the time period.

Other updates:

- Allow auto-registration name to be configured [#2986](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2986)
- SSO: Refinements [#2982](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2982)
  - Fix consistency of SSO casing and hyphenation => 'Single Sign-On'
  - Make SSO default when connecting if enabled for the endpoint
  - Move the SSO Allowed checkbox to the bottom in 'Advanced Options', so that the form does not move when the checkbox is checked and the advisory text appears
- Add check to make sure DB Schema migrations have completed (fixes an issue with diagnostics and a possible race-condition when deployed via Helm or Docker Compose) [#2977](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2977)


## 7th September 2018

Update for this week:

- Single Sign-On - Added the ability to enable SSO Login when using the Setup screen.

- Metrics - Work continues to improve the metrics integration and presentation in the UI

- Extensions - Work has started on adding extension points in the UI. This will be accomplished via decorators, in the same way that Angular uses decorators for Components etc. [#2962](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2962)

- Deploy App Manifest overrides - Added an extra step in the 'Deploy App' flow to allow you to override manifest settings before deploying [#2924](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2924) 

- Show Service plan cost when selecting a service plan (if not free) [#2959](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2959)

- E2E Tests - Resolved GitHub rate limits issues when running E2E Tests [#2949](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2949)

- Travis - The Travis build has been restructured to run jobs in parallel and E2E tests now run against PRs in addition to branches.


## 31st August 2018

Update for this week:

- Go-backend re-structure - The additional cleanup work has been merged.

- Single-Sign-On - Further work on Single-Sign On:
  - Improvements - improve error handling, add navigate straight to login option [#2522](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2522)
  - Link tokens rather than copying them [#2916](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2916)
  - Allow a Cloud Foundry endpoint to be connected with SSO login [#2928](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2928)

- Allow Client ID and Secret to be set when registering an endpoint [#2920](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2920)

- Scalability:
  - Change application list in service instance table row from vertical to chip list [#2915](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2915)
  - Convert space apps list from local to remote [#2913](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2913)

- Metrics - Work has started on tidying up and improving the metrics views

## 24th August 2018

Update for this week:

- Go-backend re-structure - This work has now been merged and should make it easier to develop with and contribute to. Some additional clean up was done and is awaiting PR review.

- Extended end-to-end test suite - Further work to build-out the E2E test suite. See:
  - Services E2E: Service Instance creation with App Binding [#2855](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2855)
  - E2E: Basic Application Routes tests [#2862](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2862)
  - E2E: Basic Application Instances tests [#2863](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2863)
  - E2E: Basic test for Cf/Org/Space users tables [#2904](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2904)

- Small improvements and fixes for the Diagnostics page [#2860](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2860)


## 17th August 2018

Update for this week:

- 2.0.1 - We tagged a 2.0.1 release. This is identical to 2.0.0 and only fixes an issue with a broken dependency - one of the pinned dependencies was no longer working. This issue only affects you if you were pushing to Cloud Foundry from the 2.0.0 tag.

- Pre-built UI - We added the ability to pre-build the UI before pushing to Cloud Foundry. This allows you to build the UI with AOT (Ahead-of-time) compilation enabled and push to CF. This will also reduce push time. See the doc [Pre-building the UI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/tree/v2-master/deploy/cloud-foundry#pre-building-the-ui).

- Go-backend re-structure. Work is almost complete on re-structuring the go backend to make it easier to develop with and contribute to. See issue [#2815](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues/2815).

- Extended end-to-end test suite

## 10th August 2018
A similar update to last week, focusing on metrics, testing and the community.

- Testing the new metrics deployment process.
- Improving the end to end test setup process, this will enable better coverage of service tests.
- Improving test coverage, both unit and end to end, of the often used list component.
- Improving test coverage of entity validation, another often used component.
- Manage application stats requests better in the application wall when there are many many started apps.
- Investigating, solving and shepherding community issues. Some of the stand out ones..
  - Stratos URLs are now consistent. Previously for the same CF the id would change every time it's registered, meaning bookmarks would need updating following every re-registration. Now as long as the CF API url doesn't change the CF id in the url will remain the same. - https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues/2798
  - Correctly report application instance counts with respect to app state - https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues/2797
  - Apply permissions to application actions (start, restart, etc) - https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues/2806

## 3 August 2018
This week we've focused on..

- Making metrics components easier to deploy. This will help us apply polish and publicise CF metrics in the coming weeks.
- Improving test suites and coverage.
- Responding to community issues. There's been an increase in use and some great contributions.
- Fixing older, but still valid, issues that haven't quite been important to address at the time.

In addition we’ve created a short (a few minutes) survey to get a better idea how the community plan to use Stratos. Answers and feedback will directly impact the direction we take Stratos, so the quicker we have responses the quicker we can act on them. Follow this link to start answering https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2L8XWST

## 27 July 2018

The main news this week is that we have released a first version of Stratos 2.0.

We've been focused over the past weeks on fixing bugs and improving tests and we're delighted to have reached this milestone.

The release details are available here - https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/releases/tag/2.0.0.

We've also started to catch up on some of the outstanding PRs, especially submitted from the community, for example:

- Change DB schema and backend to support storing a client/secret for each Endpoint [\#2622](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2622)
- Fix migrate script to work in Postgresql [\#2601](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2601)

## 20 July 2018

This week the focus has been on further testing and refinement of Release Candidate 2.

We will be publishing a Release Candidate 3 on Monday 23 July. We expect this to be the final RC and will most likely promote this to be the final Version 2 release later next week.

We've been focused on more test automation and building out more end-to-end tests, in addition to fixing a few bugs.

We had an issue with the Angular AOT + build optimization which pushed the final RC into next week. This took a while to get to the bottom of.

## 08 June 2018

The team have been working on the following issues and PRs this week:

- Front-end unit tests are unreliable in Travis [#3208](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/issues/2308) - we're seeing a lot of problems with the front-end unit tests when running in Travis - we're continuing to dig into this issue to understand what the cause is, since this is affecting reliability of PR gate checks.

- Services permissions [#2284](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2284) - wiring the user permissions service into the Service UI to ensure users are only presented with actions that they are permitted to perform.

- Allow metrics endpoint token to be shared [#2283](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2283) - adding support for the admin user to connect to a Prometheus metrics endpoint and then make that connection available to all users. Note that non-admins can only see metrics for applications that they have permission to view.

- Show whether user is an admin on the about page [#2306](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2306) - we now indicate on the about page if the current user is an administrator of Stratos.

- Add Permissions to CF Users tables [#2291](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2291) - wired in the user permissions service into the Cloud Foundry user management UI.

- Wire in actions to app state [#2288](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2288) - actions on the application view now use the same rules as in V1 to determine which actions should be shown based on the current application state.

- Quicker e2e tests for PRs  [#2273](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2273) - changed the way e2e tests run for PRs. They will now use a quicker local deployment rather than a full deployment in docker.

- Only show add and deploy buttons when there is at least 1 connected CF [#2285](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2285) - we now only show the add and deploy buttons on the application wall when there is a Cloud Foundry available.

- Fetch cf users when not cf admin [#2282](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2282) - ensuring that we use different APIs call when the user is not an admin in order to retrieve the data to display for the user list.

- Hide service broker card if broker information isn't available [#2287](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2287) - we now hide the service broker card if we can not retrieve the broker metadata.

- Only allow password change if user has password.write scope [#2278](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2278) - user is now only presented with the option to change their password if they have permission to do so.

- Backend logging improvements [#2267](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2267) - first round of tidy up to the back-end logging, including not logging an error when verifying the user's seesion when they don't have a valid session.

- Use local fonts [#2260](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2260) - all fonts are now served up by the app itself to allow air-gapped deployment.

- Endpoint confirmation modals [#2258](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2258) - added confirmation modals when disconnecting or un-registering and endpoint.

- Added theming section to developer guide readme [#2249](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2249) - added documentation on how theming is done for Stratos.

- Update permissions when when entities are updated [#2221](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/pull/2221) - we now ensure that permissions are updated when endpoints (and other entities) are updated in Stratos.

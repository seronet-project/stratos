# Features

> **NOTE** This branch is a work-in-progress Angular 2.x version of Stratos. For the current Angular 1 based version see [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/tree/master](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/tree/master). This version is at an early development stage and we welcome feedback, input and contributions. This version does not currently have feature parity with the Angular 1 version specified below - see the [Development Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for more information.

Stratos provides the feature set outline below. Some of these are illustrated in the [Screenshots gallery](images/screenshots/README.md).

  * Application View
     * The ability to see the detail for a specific application with a tabbed view providing detailed information:
        *  Summary Tab - showing key application metadata, instance information, routes and bound services

Stratos is an Open Source Web-based UI (Console) for managing Cloud Foundry. It allows users and administrators to both manage applications running in the Cloud Foundry cluster and perform cluster management tasks.

If you are looking for the V1 version of Stratos, you can find it in the [master](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/tree/master) branch.

## Quick Start

To get started quickly, we recommend following the steps to deploy the Stratos Console as a Cloud Foundry Application - see [here](deploy/cloud-foundry).

If you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) installed, you can quickly deploy Stratos using the all-in-one container:
```
$ docker run -p 4443:443 splatform/stratos:latest 
```

Once that has finished, you can then access Stratos by visiting https://localhost:4443.

## Deploying Stratos

Stratos can be deployed in the following environments:

1. Cloud Foundry, as an application. See [guide](deploy/cloud-foundry)
2. Kubernetes, using a Helm chart. See [guide](deploy/kubernetes)
3. Docker, single container deploying all components. See [guide](deploy/all-in-one)

## Troubleshooting
Please see our [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting) page.

## Project Planning
We use [ZenHub](https://zenhub.com) for project planning. Feel free to head over to the [Boards](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos#boards)
tab and have a look through our pipelines and milestones. Please note in order to view the Github ZenHub Boards tab you will need the [ZenHub
browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension). Alternatively, to view the planning board without the extension visit our [ZenHub Project Page](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/boards)
